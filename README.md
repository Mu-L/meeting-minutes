## Introduction

Meetily is a privacy-first AI meeting assistant that runs entirely on your local machine. It captures your meetings, transcribes them in real-time, and generates summaries, all without sending any data to the cloud. This makes it the perfect solution for professionals and enterprises who need to maintain complete control over their sensitive information.

## Why Meetily?

While there are many meeting transcription tools available, this solution stands out by offering:

- **Privacy First:** All processing happens locally on your device.
- **Cost-Effective:** Uses open-source AI models instead of expensive APIs.
- **Flexible:** Works offline and supports multiple meeting platforms.
- **Customizable:** Self-host and modify for your specific needs.

<details>
<summary>The Privacy Problem</summary>

Meeting AI tools create significant privacy and compliance risks across all sectors:

- **$4.4M average cost per data breach** (IBM 2024)
- **‚Ç¨5.88 billion in GDPR fines** issued by 2025
- **400+ unlawful recording cases** filed in California this year

Whether you're a defense consultant, enterprise executive, legal professional, or healthcare provider, your sensitive discussions shouldn't live on servers you don't control. Cloud meeting tools promise convenience but deliver privacy nightmares with unclear data storage practices and potential unauthorized access.

**Meetily solves this:** Complete data sovereignty on your infrastructure, zero vendor lock-in, and full control over your sensitive conversations.

</details>

## Features

- **Local First:** All processing is done on your machine. No data ever leaves your computer.
- **Real-time Transcription:** Get a live transcript of your meeting as it happens.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Generate summaries of your meetings using powerful language models.
- **Multi-Platform:** Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Open Source:** Meetily is open source and free to use.

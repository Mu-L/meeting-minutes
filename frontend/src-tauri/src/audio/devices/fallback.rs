// Bluetooth device fallback strategy for stable Core Audio recording (macOS-specific)
//
// This module implements automatic fallback to built-in devices when
// Bluetooth devices are detected as system defaults on macOS. This solves:
// - Bluetooth variable sample rate issues (Core Audio may resample dynamically)
// - Inconsistent sample rates when mixing mic + system audio streams
// - ScreenCaptureKit capturing Bluetooth-processed streams with variable timing
//
// Strategy (macOS-only):
// 1. Get system default devices (mic + speaker)
// 2. Detect if EACH is Bluetooth using InputDeviceKind::detect()
// 3. For EACH Bluetooth device detected ‚Üí Override to built-in MacBook device
// 4. Return final devices with detailed rationale logging
//
// Note: Bluetooth mic and speaker are checked INDEPENDENTLY - one, both, or
// neither could be Bluetooth and need override.
//
// User still hears via Bluetooth (playback uses default), but recording
// captures via stable wired path (built-in mic + ScreenCaptureKit from built-in).

/// Get safe recording devices with automatic Bluetooth fallback (macOS-specific)
///
/// This function intelligently selects audio devices for recording on macOS:
/// - Checks microphone: if Bluetooth ‚Üí override to built-in mic
/// - Checks speaker: if Bluetooth ‚Üí override to built-in speaker
/// - Each device is evaluated INDEPENDENTLY
///
/// # Rationale for Bluetooth Override
///
/// Bluetooth devices on macOS can have variable sample rates as Core Audio
/// and the Bluetooth stack may resample dynamically. When ScreenCaptureKit
/// captures from a Bluetooth output device, it captures the processed stream
/// which may have inconsistent sample rates, causing sync issues when mixing
/// with the microphone stream.
///
/// Built-in devices have fixed, consistent sample rates ‚Üí reliable mixing.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Tuple of (microphone, system_audio) where:
/// - Some(device) = Device found and safe for recording
/// - None = No device available (non-fatal, recording can continue with single source)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// // When AirPods are default mic, built-in speaker is default output:
/// let (mic, system) = get_safe_recording_devices_macos()?;
///
/// // Logs:
/// // "üéß Bluetooth microphone detected: AirPods Pro"
/// // "‚Üí Overriding to stable built-in: MacBook Pro Microphone"
/// // "‚úÖ Using wired speaker: MacBook Pro Speakers"
/// ```
